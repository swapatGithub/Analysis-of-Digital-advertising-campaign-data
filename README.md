# Analysis-of-Digital-advertising-campaign-data
The purpose of this data challenge is to evaluate the impact of digital ad impression on a conversion and performing market segmentation on user data

The data set contains set of events recorded by the system during digital marketing advertising campaigns. Each record is an event represented by a column ‘event_type’. Below are the four types of events given in the data
•	“imp” - An Advertising Impression—An exposure to an ad online
•	“click” – A click on an online advertisement
•	“pc_conv” - Post Click Conversion—A purchase that occurs after a user has clicked an ad
•	“pv_conv” - Post View Conversion—A purchase that occurs after a user has viewed an ad

Below are the deliverables:
•	Explain which of the impression variables are most strongly related to conversions
•	Explain how we can group or cluster users (using the field user_id_64) and alter impression factors to improve media effectiveness with the group in question
•	Explain how can we evaluate sequences of impressions that occur prior to conversions in a way that helps us determine whether the impressions actually influenced the conversion or if the impression and the conversion outcome are unrelated
